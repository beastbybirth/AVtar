They are designed to measure specific physical quantities or characteristics, such as temperature, pressure, light, sound, motion, proximity, or chemical composition. Sensors are widely used in various industries and applications, including automotive systems, consumer electronics, healthcare, industrial automation, environmental monitoring, and many others.

                        Sensors work by converting physical phenomena into electrical signals that can be interpreted and analyzed by other electronic components or systems. They are typically made up of two main parts: a sensing element and a transducer. The sensing element is responsible for detecting the physical stimulus, such as a change in temperature or the presence of light. The transducer converts the detected signal into an electrical form that can be easily processed and utilized by other electronic devices.</strong></p><br><br>
